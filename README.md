# Hybrid-Anomaly-Detector-final
This is my C++ project as part of Advanced Programming 1 course at Bar Ilan University.<br/>
It is an implementation of Anomaly Detector:
1. Learn - receive data,learn it by inserting it into database and analyzing it.
2. Detect - receive new data and checking if it has any anomalies, by comparing it to existing data(from learn).

It can detect anomalies using 2 different methods:
1. Linear regression.
2. Circular - using Welzl algorithm.

All of the above was implemented into a server using TCP protocol, also created CLI to receive  user requests.

## Main Achievements
- Implementing Design Patterns and Architectures(Command, Bridge, Client-Server, etc).<br/>
- Using network protocols.<br/>
- Working with data structures and STL.<br/>
- Maintaining data(files and network).<br/>
- Implementing algorithms into a program.<br/>
- Concurrency  programming using threads.<br/>
